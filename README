listlace is a music player with a REPL.
It allows you to forge complex playlists
with ease... as long as you know your
way around Ruby.

No more staring a database in the face.
No more click, shift-click, ctrl-click,
ctrl-click, drag-and-drop, click,
double-click.

Conjuring audio with spells is much more
appropriate, don't you think?

I'm thinking it'll go a little something
like this. Observe:

    $ listlace
    Hello, you have 1466 songs.
    ll> muse = album("Origin of Symmetry") + song("Blackout", artist: "Muse")
     => Playlist (12 songs)
    ll> maps = album("Turning The Mind") - song("Die Happy, Die Smiling")
     => Playlist (11 songs)
    ll> playlist = muse.shuffle + maps.shuffle
     => Playlist (23 songs)
    ll> playlist.play
    Now Playing: Blackout - Muse (0:00 / 4:22)
    ll> p
    Paused: Blackout - Muse (0:07 / 4:22)
    ll> seek 3..10
    Paused: Blackout - Muse (3:10 / 4:22)
    ll> p
    Now Playing: Blackout - Muse (3:10 / 4:22)
    ll> playlist.save "Maps & Muse"
    ll> status
    Playing playlist "Maps & Muse" (1 / 23)
    Now Playing: Blackout - Muse (4:04 / 4:22)
    ll> next
    Now Playing: Space Dementia - Muse (0:00 / 6:21)

And so on.
