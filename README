listlace is a music player with a REPL.
It allows you to forge complex playlists
with ease... as long as you know your
way around Ruby.

No more staring a database in the face.
No more click, shift-click, ctrl-click,
ctrl-click, drag-and-drop, click,
double-click.

Conjuring audio with spells is much more
appropriate, don't you think?

-- install

It's a gem. So do this:

  gem install listlace

But you also need mplayer. It has to be
at /usr/bin/mplayer, for now.

-- usage

The gem gives you an executable called
'listlace'. So do this:

  $ listlace

It will make a '.listlace' directory in
$HOME, where the database of tracks and
playlists is stored. Then it will give you
a prompt. Don't be alarmed, it speaks
Ruby.

The only way to populate the database right
now is to import your iTunes library.
That goes a little something like this:

  >> import_from_itunes "/Users/jeremy/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music Library.xml"

Once you've done that, you can play with the
Track and Playlist models, do some queries.
You can't actually play the music, because
that part's broken, sorry. Not for long.
