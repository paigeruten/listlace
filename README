listlace is a music player with a REPL.
It allows you to forge complex playlists
with ease... as long as you know your
way around Ruby.

No more staring a database in the face.
No more click, shift-click, ctrl-click,
ctrl-click, drag-and-drop, click,
double-click.

Conjuring audio with spells is much more
appropriate, don't you think?

-- install

It's a gem. So do this:

  $ gem install listlace

But you also need mplayer. It has to be
at /usr/bin/mplayer, for now.

-- usage

The gem gives you an executable called
'listlace'. So do this:

  $ listlace

It will make a '.listlace' directory in
$HOME, where the database of tracks and
playlists is stored. Then it will give you
a prompt. Don't be alarmed, it speaks
Ruby.

The only way to populate the database right
now is to import your iTunes library.
That goes a little something like this:

  >> import :itunes, "/Users/jeremy/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music Library.xml"

Now you can play your music.

-- p's and q's

p is the most important command. It's the
play command. It's also the pause/resume
command. You can pass it some tracks or a
playlist, and it will queue up the music
and start playing it, sequentially. If you
don't pass it anything, that's when it acts
as a pause/resume button.

q is the queue command. You can pass it some
tracks or a playlist and it'll add them to the
queue. The queue is just an array of tracks
to be played in order. The p command by
itself will start playing the queue.
